**Title:**
```
🚀 Agent Infrastructure Platform: The OS for the Trillion-Agent Economy
```

**Content:**
```
Just shipped a complete, production-ready infrastructure platform for multi-agent systems!

🎯 **What it is:**
The operating system for the trillion-agent economy - think Kubernetes but purpose-built for AI agents.

🏗️ **7 Infrastructure Layers:**

**1. Universal Communication Protocols** (The "USB-C for Agents")
• MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Agent ↔ Tools/Data
• A2A (Agent-to-Agent) - Direct agent negotiation  
• ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) - Async orchestration
• ANP (Agent Network Protocol) - Agent discovery

**2. Distributed Identity & Trust**
• Self-describing Agent Cards with capabilities
• W3C Verifiable Credentials
• Multi-factor Reputation scoring
• MPC (Multi-Party Computation) key management

**3. Shared Memory & State**
• Hybrid Vector + Graph storage
• Episodic memory per-agent
• Semantic search + relational queries
• Consensus mechanisms

**4. Orchestration & Coordination**
• Hierarchical task orchestration
• Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
• Swarm intelligence with consensus
• 10k+ concurrent agent support

**5. Compute & Execution**
• Containerized agent runtime
• Secure Python sandbox (AST validated)
• TEE support (Intel SGX/AMD SEV)
• Resource limits & isolation

**6. Economic & Incentive Layer**
• Micropayment channels (off-chain)
• Resource marketplace with bidding
• Reputation staking with slashing

**7. Governance & Safety**
• Policy-as-code (<10ms evaluation)
• Multi-level kill switches
• Immutable audit trails

🐍 **Tech Stack:**
• Python 3.11+ with full type hints
• Pydantic for data validation
• FastAPI for API endpoints
• Asyncio throughout
• Docker + docker-compose

📦 **Installation:**
pip install agent-infrastructure-platform

🚀 **Quick Start:**
```python
from agent_infrastructure_platform import Agent, Orchestrator

# Create specialized agents
researcher = ResearchAgent()
writer = WritingAgent()

# Orchestrate workflow
orchestrator = Orchestrator()
orchestrator.register_agent(researcher, ["research"])
orchestrator.register_agent(writer, ["writing"])

results = await orchestrator.execute(plan)
```

### 2. LinkedIn Post
```
Excited to announce the Agent Infrastructure Platform (AIP) - a comprehensive framework for building, deploying, and governing multi-agent systems at scale.

What makes AIP unique:
🔹 Protocol-native (MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP)
🔹 Decentralized identity & trust
🔹 Built-in economic incentives
🔹 Production-ready governance

Perfect for anyone building the next generation of AI agent systems.
